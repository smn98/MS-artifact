cold pages - when a page is accessed first after a long time(already learned)

Berti works in 2 modes
	1. Berti mode : uses the learned best offset to prefetch 

	2. Burst mode: is used on cold pages, i.e., when a page is accessed after a long time.
		        the thing it does is, it prefetches all the blocks between the first accessed and the best delta of the page

*potential misses - misses if the prefetcher would not have been active, which includes actual misses and prefetch hits

where is the first accessed offset stored. How is the table formed
