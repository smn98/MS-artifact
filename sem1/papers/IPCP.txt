instruction pointer classification
l1 prefetcher better performance than l2 prefetchers - *coherence issues
state of art prefetchers not a good fit for l1, as they are global and huge size
not a global pattern recognizer but categorizes instructions based on 

3 classes of instruction pointer - simple stride, complex stride

prefetchers are used both at l1 and l2.
degree of prefetching is more at the l2 as it has more resources.
No prefetching is done at the llc level and the same prefetch requests by l1 and l2 are brought into llc
l2 prefetcher does not undergo any training. the trained metadata is passed to l2 by l1.
no cplx class prefetching in l2.


questions:

sim points
l2 perfetching
deep prefetching


improvement: 

-CPLX takes more time to train
-long term access patterns not identified by 
-prefetch distance
-irregular trends
-overprediction
-temporal prefetching
-pq and mshr high requirements
-common core global prefetcher in case of multihtreaded application
-metadata with additional hardware to somehow predict more correctly at the L2.
