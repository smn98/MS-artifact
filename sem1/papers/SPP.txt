main ideas:
	compressed history 
	prefetch across pages
	adaptive throttle 

drawbacks of previous techniques:
	-complex prefetchers have limited prefetching depth.
	-increasing depth of PC based delta prefetchers does not
	    show significant performance benefits
	-lookahead mechanism- high hardware complexity
	-no knowledge of virtual memory


intro:
	signature stores access patterns ina compressed form
	detects locality between two physical pages
	signature path - throttling
	purely based on memory access stream
	
motivation:
	-huge storage overhead for storing complex patterns
	-lookahead prefetching is essetial for compelx patterns
	-stream throttling as prefetch depth depends upon applications
		and stream specific
	-access pattern which cross physical page boundaries are
		difficult to exploit. per-page warmup times are more
	-no temporal ordering detected

Design overview:
		lookahead mechanism.
		a signature path is speculated using signature and deltas 
			associated
	
Drawbacks: 
many arithmatic operations increases critical path	
divide table overhead
random patterns are hard to detect, which are predicted better by BOP

Method:

1. Learning access patterns
	signature stores the previous deltas
	L2 cache access address is used to index ST.
	signature is used to index into the PT to get the delta
	per-delta confidence decides if the prefetch is done or not
	If a new delta is encountered, the delta with least confidence is replaced
	Signatures corresponds to physical pages
	patterns are common (global) to all pages - reduces redundancy
	new signature is calculated using the equation and replaces the old one
	
2. Prefetching
	after updating ST, SPP again accesses PT to prefetch and predict following deltas
	prefetching is done if path confidence is more than the threshold
	the next lookahead is also done by PT by calculating a speculative signature
		using the current signature and the delta
	this lookahead continues till paht confidence falls below threshold
	another threshold is used to decide where the prefetch will be filled
	a global scaling factor alpha is used to throttle prefetching depth
	prefetching is also throttled down when read queue has not enough resources

3. Page boundaries
	GHR stores delta patterns that crosses page boundaries
	When a page is accessed first time(no signature) it's offset is searched in the
		GHR and if found prefetching is started.
	A new signature is generated which means if the page is accessed later, no 
		need of using GHR even if page boundary is crossed
	Does not suffer from long per-page warm-up
	
4. Prefetch filter	
	used to avoid re-prefetching
